- Provided David with a summary of our commitments to Portland University, which is  education materials and a server running blockchain.  Our commitments are due January 27. 

Other work:
- Monday: participated in West weekly meeting.
- Completed the mainnet scan program.  It is running on my SUSE server, and scanning mainnet every day reporting activity and possible anomolies. The scan is automatically started, and is always within 12 hours of current block height.  I provided the information to David and Berzeck as I wrote the scan, and they found it useful.  I will provide the collected information to the West this week, for comments.

 

## Next week's and upcoming week's activities
Work for Portland University Blockchain Program: 
- Write the guide "NULS-PSU Blockchain Usage Guide”, which is a step-by-step “walk-through” to access and use the NULS WEB Wallet, and the NULS Explorer; to deploy, test, access, and display a smart contract; and to use a distributed application.
- Create a frontend for the ProductReview smart contract.
- Provide a configurable excel document which shows the token supply across the life of a blockchain, including inflation and deinflation. It's configurable so the students can make changes and see the results.
