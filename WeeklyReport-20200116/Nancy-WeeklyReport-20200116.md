## This week's summary

### CODING
- Updated and refactored all the nulsws-python code. Changed to
 match the PEP8 proposal doc. as suggested by Moshe. Some things should not be PEP8 
 compliant because interact with Java components that don't insist on all-lowercase, etc.
- Installed pyscaffold as recommended by Moshe. 
- Implemented using yapf, flake8 and venv. 
- Renamed / reorganized directories, and moved most variables into dictionaries for a 
cleaner namespace.
- Finished adding config-parser library to user settings can be in Nuls-style, ncf type 
files.
- Added http to the python project.
although it's only http1.  Http2 is another whole decision on what libraries to use.
made all the code PEP8 compliant except for the line length which I put at 90 instead of 79.

### CLOUD
- Got started using Berzeck's new west server, chain factory and the 
testnet.
