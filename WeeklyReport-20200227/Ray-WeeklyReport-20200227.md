## This week's summary

NULS 2.0 integration for Ledger wallet

1. Completed TRANSFER/ACCOUNT_ALIAS transaction parsing and signing code, refer to https://github.com/ccccbjcn/ledger-nuls/commits/master for details.

2. Discussed with Niels, Ledger as a hardware wallet has insufficient resource(SDRAM) to suport NULS 2.0 all transaction type signatures. So currently it supports TRANSFER/ACCOUNT_ALIAS transaction types that are enough to meet user needs.

## Next week's plan

1. To do NULS 2.0 Ledger TRANSFER/ACCOUNT_ALIAS transaction signature integration test on Ledger wallet with desktop APP(nytro-wallet).

2. NULS integration TrustWallet Staking

    On-hold.
