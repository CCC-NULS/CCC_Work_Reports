Work for Portland  State University (PSU) Blockchain Program:
- Spoke to and/or emailed instructions to 7 students who experienced one of two chain factory bugs which have subsequently  been fixed.
- Documented the 2 bugs that these students experienced and provided them to Vivi. Thanks! Vivi. 
- Provided requests and feedback to Sam JS regarding the DApp changes for for Portland State.  He did a great job.
- Modified PSU-NULS blockchain Usage Guide (for the upcoming Lab) to include: 
detailed instructions and screen shot of web wallet operations, 
including token transfers; 
expanding Section 3 (smart contract) to include detailed smart contract code explanation, and more screen shots;
additional instructions in Section 4 regarding using the DApp and examining the Explorer for evidence of  DApp writewReview activity.
- Talked to NTC and Berzeck regarding Chain Factory inflation ration value, based upon PSU's reported problem entering ".04".
- Researched with Berzeck the behavior of the Chain Factory Blockchain Web Wallet.  Due to the cross-chain wallet feature where one can transfer tokens between NULS mainnet and the CF blockchain,  node service reset and pauses were noted.
- Continued research indicated that it was possible for a node service reset to cause the Web Wallet to be a NULS Web Wallet. I now know what to explain to the students to insure they use the web wallet effectively.
- Created a video showing the students how to use the Web Wallet, import an account, create an account, transfer tokens, etc. 
- Communicated with Kristi to address all her requests, including documentation changes, creating 2 videos (1 is done), creating accounts, etc.
- Berzeck rebooted the westteam server and mongoDb did not start!  Researched the problem.  It was caused by a file that did not have the correct ownership. Provided Berzeck and Nancy and explanation of the problem so they can fix it if it happens again. 
- sent big Thank you! to Nancy, Angel, SAM JS, and Berzeck for all the work they have done in the past weeks to support PSU.  Nancy helped out greatly in finalizing the commands required for the Dapp to successfully the @payable method in the smart contract.
