## This Week's Summary

### CODING
 
## PSU 
- PORTLAND STATE UNIV. (PSU) - Worked with Sam to implement Kathy and PSU's requirements. Finished adding call contract code.  It is posted, working and ready for students at westteam.nulstar.com. 
- PYTHON-JSONRPC Tool - Completed the first phase of a Python JSON-RPC api tool that uses the NULS api for interacting with the blockchain. Added routines to interact with the blockchain. This tool was developed to help Kathy add, import, fund and check 25 new PSU students. We need to rename it.


### CLOUD

- Helped with our two servers updating settings, installations, rebooting, etc. 
- Checked Facebook for imposters and spam. Some imposter accounts still appear to exist - despite duplicate requests to Facebook to please fix.
- Researched other Slack-like tools like Gitter. Gitter doesn't sound fast enough for us. Have used another one of the free ones and it was too underpowered.
- Helped Berzeck create a TokenLife subdomain on Westteam. 

### OTHER
- Setup / hosted our Zoom staff meeting. Researched offices and gave Berzeck my recommendation.
- Worked with Kathy on some technical issues.
- Retweeted NULS tweets and scanned Facebook page for NULS impersonators.

### Next Week's Plan

- Continue to help with the Portland Univ. project as needed.
- Name the JSONRPC Python tool and get it into the right place on github.
- The Token Calc/Life program needs to be moved into the offical location on the Westteam server as soon as PSU is finished using it.
- Continue to support nginx. Need to get automated tools running.
- Correct doc errors when I see them.
- Attend meetings when requested. 
- Help find other cloud providers.
- ON HOLD: The python websocket project to be setup to run with an installer like Pip, Anaconda or something similar. 

### Work Problem Feedback

- None.
