- Working on Blockchain demonstration environment.  People want to be able to demonstrate that our blockchain, and its features,  is as easy to use as it is to configuring using chain factory.   This includes ftp, firewall config, mongodb, nuls explorer and nuls web wallet. (It was the ftp and firewall config that took most of the time. currently using Umbuntu on Hetzner.) I will update the CF document with this information.
