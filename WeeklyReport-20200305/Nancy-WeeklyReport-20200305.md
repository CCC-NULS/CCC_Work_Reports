## This Week's Summary

### CODING & PSU
  
- PORTLAND STATE UNIV. (PSU) - The Python/Anaconda/Flask app TokenLife is now running on Westteam at http://westteam.nulstar.com:5000 . This is in addition to tokenlife.westteam.com  which is still active (via my pythonanywhere account). The app is running under systemctl (systemctl status vikingapp) and has logs in /var/log/psu and you can also check the nginx logs at /var/log/nginx .
- Fixed a very bad bug in the carriage return bug in VikingLife that was stopping the entire app from running correctly.
- Created systemctl services for both apps so they reboot automatically, etc.
- Worked on a plan to package the python apps - probably pip but wish there was something simpler. Conda is not appropriate. 
- Looked into frameworks for vue and css for future apps. I like Figment and will try out the free version.
- Updated the JSONRPC Python tool.

### OTHER
- Setup / hosted our Zoom staff meeting. Researched offices and gave Berzeck my recommendation.
- Edited the Chain Factory wording list from Berzeck.
- Corrected minor errors on the Nuls-v2 readme, and did pull request.
- Deleted Facebook spam.
- Investigated naming Kathy's Youtube tutorial channel. Changing a channel name requires moving videos which could be a problem.
- Experimented with sharing a file on Yandex disk to use instead of Google.
- Investigated and researched online for partners and provided lists to Westteam group.

### Next Week's Plan
- Finish editing en.js for Chain Factory.
- Map a route to port 5000 for TokenLife. Document what I've done on Westteam.
- Continue to help with the Portland Univ. project as needed.
- Name the JSONRPC Python tool and get it into the right place on github.
- Correct doc errors when I see them. Attend meetings when requested. 
- Melp with google docs, more tweeting. Keep checking Facebook.
- Help Kathy with the mailbox.
- ON HOLD: The python websocket project to be setup to run with an installer like Pip, Anaconda or something similar. 

### Work Problem Feedback

- None.
