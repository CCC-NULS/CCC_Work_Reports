NULS Academy -- creation of English videos
- Researched Nuls staking.  Am creating the Nuls staking video before the end of the week.

Staking information:
- Wrote a program that reports all staking information for all nodes, as per Berzeck's request. Doing some final edits to fine-tune the report.
- This will be invoked via a frontend app so it is available to everyone. Also, I am adding staking information by node for the node owners.

Other Activities
- Attended weekly westteam meeting 
- Offered to provide support to all companies that have requested a free blockchain from Chain Factory. I know Chain Factory well. I am very good at Customer Service.
 

## Next week's activities
- Complete staking video, and staking program.
- Start the Token Economics review, and subsequent video.
