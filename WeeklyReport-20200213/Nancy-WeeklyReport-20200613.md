## This week's summary

### CODING
 
Portland Univ (PSU): 
- Edited the Smart Contract Review Dapp to point at the new West server blockchain.
- Worked on the Call Contract portion of the smart contract review dapp so that we can 
add reviews and transactions.
- Mostly finished the Token Calc dapp and put it online for the Portland class to use. 
Just fixing bugs now.
- Worked on a ping solution for servers that aren't responsive.


### CLOUD

- Helped Berzeck with various servers and transferring Nulstar.com to a new registrar.
- Dave gave me access to our Facebook page. I've checked it for spam and filled out a 
complaint form to help block these spammers. Blocked many spammers from commenting on 
our page.
- Helped debug server up/down/non-responsive issues. It's essential that our servers 
stay functional when the students start using them.

### OTHER
- Edited an announcement article for Berzeck.
- Attended Dave's weekly West meeting. Helped Kathy with minor
technical issues.
- Spoke to Darrell in San Francisco - a possible new employee - about working for us.  


### Next week's plan

- <b>CODING</b> - Finish and update the smart contract with Chain Factory app. The 
python websocket project needs it's docs updating and files moved into correct 
placement. The Token Calc/Life program needs to be moved in the offical location.
- <b>CLOUD</b> - Continue to install necessary software and support nginx, etc. 
Hopefully get some automated tools running for status.
- Once the Nulstar.com domain transfer is done, we'll switch the app I'm hosting on 
Pythonanywhere to a the tokenlife.nulstar.com subdomain.
- <b>DOCS</b> - Correct errors when I see them. 
- <b>TEAM</b> - Attend meetings when requested. Continue to help with the Portland Univ. project.

### Work Problem Feedback

- None.
