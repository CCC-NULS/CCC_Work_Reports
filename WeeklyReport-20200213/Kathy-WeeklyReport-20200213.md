Work for Portland University Blockchain Program:

- Provided Token-economics to Nancy, who re-fitted it as an application with a GUI interface so that it is easily executable for PSU students who are unfamiliar with python.

- Conversations with DAve to insure we are delivering on our promises to PSU.
- Re-wrote the PSU-NULS Blockchain Usage guide to provide more information and experience with smart contracts. (Used in Lab #2 starting Feb 24.) Also, provided written summaries of smart contract, web wallets, and security, to be included in PSU material.
- Registered as a non-degree student at PSU, so they could add me to their class.
