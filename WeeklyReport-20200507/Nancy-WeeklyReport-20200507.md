### This Week's Summary

#### CODING 
- Worked on rewriting the Tokenomics dapp with Vue.js, Vuetify and Python. Got some difficult parts to work including the integration with Flask.
- Wrote scripts for getting Twitter data. Tried out different packages. Ended up using Twint which relies on webscraping rather than api calls. 
- Signed up for a Twitter developer account even though the free account has limits on use. Found a good python twitter library called python-twitter. 

#### OTHER
- VIDEOS: Finished editing "Staking with NULS" parts 1 and 2. Added graphics and lettering. Posted on Youtube. Improved the keywords on a few of our videos.

- DAPPS: Write a front-end for Kathy's new node analysis code.
