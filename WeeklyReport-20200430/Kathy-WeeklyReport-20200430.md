NULS Academy -- creation of English videos
- did more research on staking. 
- re-created the staking video.
- divided the video in 3 parts, and recorded each part seperately.  
- turned staking 3-part video plus overlay text to Nancy. 

Staking information -- there is a lot of staking information, and some very large stakes and unstakes happening! 
- created 3 reports, with optional date range, and consensus node list.  I am finalizing the reports, and expect to be done on/before saturday, may 2.
- the reports: 1.) lists information for staking and unstaking sorted by account and date within account. 2.) plots staking and unstaking, across time, 3. tracking total staked across time.
- the plan is to provide interested people  with a gui interface on the west team server.  In the meantime I will provide the ability to get the report(s) on west team, plus I will setup an automated email for anyone who requests a report.
