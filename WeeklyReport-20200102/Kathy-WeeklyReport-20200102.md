## This week's summary 
 
- ported NTC project "monitor mainnet"  to a server. Identified requirements to complete phase 1.  reset phase 1 due date to Jan 7, to accomodate week off work.
- supported Vibook in their POCM project.
- researched public service queries to write a routine to check for recent yellow/red cards of a consensus node.  This is not a lot of work, and would benefit node owners! 
- spent way to much time identifying the network issue with my "out of service" node.  Turns out it was the fault of the cloud provider. 

 

## Next week's and upcoming week's activities
- Provide edits to  Angelillou's nulsjs documentation.
- Setup a d'app for Chain Factory demonstration.  This is important for people who are considering using it for education.
