## This week's summary 
- Attended monday's weekly west meeting. Commitment: work with David on PSU document, provide Chain Factory demo node to West.
- Completed working CF Blockchain demonstration environment. This involved resolving web wallet issue, and performance issues.  Note, people want to be able to demonstrate that our blockchain, and its features,  is as easy to use as it is to configuring using chain factory.   This includes ftp, firewall config, mongodb, nuls explorer and nuls web wallet. (It was the ftp and firewall config that took most of the time. currently using Umbuntu on Hetzner.) I will update the CF document with this information.
- Completed a python program to estimate the earnings of a typical consensus node, as the number of consensus nodes increases to 200.  My calculations involve some assumptions and some interpretations of the coinbase formulae.  I am looking to NTC for confirmation that my results are correct.
- Working on updating Chain Factory Guide (g_factory.md). 
- Met with David to discuss next steps with PSU and Chain Factory, plus other West initiatives. 
- Ongoing support to AccuChain, Liberty Bell, Token Network in the area of POCM.
