## This week's summary 
- Supported our 4 remaining hackathlon entries.  Nik, TryCrypto, ran out of time.  I requested he provide a document summarizing his experience and recommendations to Nuls in the area of useability and security. I provided the document to Dave, Berseck, Reaper, Pen, and Nancy.
- Nancy and AccuChain handed in their respective projects for the hackathon.
- Started reviewing the hackathon entries.  Comments and ratings due October 15.
- Completed i_public_service.md, d_public_service.md, and i_rpc_protocol.md.   Regarding i_public_service.md,  I added environment setup instructions, JSONRPC use instructions and examples, and some clarification to the provided examples. Nancy began reviewing a document today, and in 2 weeks Berzeck will be available to review docs. So this effort will speed up. 
- Sent ChainBox survey to 6 people.  One has returned. 
- Last week, I attended "Blockchain Impact Weekend -- dApp, Blockchain Applications and Token Economy".  We will partner with the host ABC for future events.
