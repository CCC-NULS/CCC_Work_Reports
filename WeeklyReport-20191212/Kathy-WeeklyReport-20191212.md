## This week's summary 
- Edited the "Consortium Chain" article.  Waiting for one more person to review and then I return it to Amy.
- Modified Chain Factory Guide (c_factory.md) to include steps with examples for setting up the purchased CF blockchain.   
- Wrote a python program to examine mainnet blocks and transactions (using public service). It gives us the opportunity to understand what our mainnet is being used for. The program currently reports on transaction activity. I will be running it to report on activity for a 24 hour interval.
- Attended  meetup "SF Crypto Product Manager Coalition" at Starfish Networks, a co-working facility for "emerging tech" including blockchain. Discussed with Jeff Nowak, opportunity for NULS to co-host meetings with Starfish, and host our own meetings.  It is a great facility and we are considering using it for office space and meeting space in 2020.  
- Met Nik, WhenHub, with David and Berzeck to discuss their POCM next steps. WhenHub is moving forward with setting up their first production POCM.
- Nik from WhenHub showed us his Dapp Starter facility.  It is designed to provide web developers the steps they need to create Dapp.  We agreed to discuss further what is required to get NULS on the list of selectable chains for Dapp Starter.
- Ongoing support to AccuChain, Liberty Bell, Token Network in the area of POCM.
