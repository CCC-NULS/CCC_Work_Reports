## This Week's Summary

### CODING & PSU
  
- PORTLAND STATE UNIV. (PSU) - Monitored dapps VikingChain and TokenLife. Completed pull request for Sam's master repo and changes rolled into master.

- Finished nulspy-webmonitor. Connected it via REST api to WirePusher on my Android so it will notify me if anyone leaves a comment on 2020 Facebook posts.

- New name for the python http project will be something like nulspy-http-request or similar.
