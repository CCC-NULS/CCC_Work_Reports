Work for Portland State University (PSU) Blockchain Program:
- supported students as they started and completed their Lab for Wallet, Explorer, and smart contract. PLUS support students who just started Chain Factory.
- worked with 7  of the 20 students who need  assistance.  This was expected as the students had a business background, not a technical background.
- Working to finalize wrap-up meeting with Kristi, Stan, and Berzeck.  Tentatively scheduled for early next week.

NULS Academy -- creation of English videos
- Our goal is to provide quality education about blockchain and NULS, in easily “digestible” chunks.  We are creating our videos to three tracks per topic: introduction (for blockchain/NULS beginners), intermediate (for users), and detailed (for heavy users, or developers).
- met with Nancy 3 times to discuss NULS Education Video details, including video resolution details.  Nancy has video editing expertise.
- Nancy and I created YouTube channel called NULS Academy (Thank you! Joao for your great naming idea)
- All  videos that I have created have been ported over to NULS Academy. Currently, I am adding descriptions to the videos.
- I got delayed in creating the NULS Wallet video due to cold and throat issue.  Will complete by March 19.
